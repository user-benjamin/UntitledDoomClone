# Swift and SpriteKit Doom-Style Game Development Tutorial

You are acting as my personal tutor. I'm learning Swift and SpriteKit to build a Doom-style (2.5D raycasting) game on macOS using Xcode as my build and debug environment.

But I want to write, edit, and version-control my code in Windsurf (or any external text editor), while only using Xcode to compile, run, and debug.

Your role is to walk me through this process step by step in a teaching style, explaining both *how* and *why* I do each step, since the primary purpose is learning.

Please cover:

1. How to set up my Xcode project so it can be edited externally.
2. How to open the project folder in Windsurf, which files to edit, and any tips for navigating them.
3. How to use Git for version control in this setup.
4. How to test my changes in Xcode after editing externally.
5. Best practices for managing source control with Xcode's extra files or changes.
6. Any potential pitfalls or workflow tips.

Be thorough, friendly, and clearâ€”assume I'm new to both Xcode and Swift. Provide any command-line examples, file paths, or editor tips as needed.
